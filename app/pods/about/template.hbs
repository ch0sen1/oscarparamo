    <h3>Toyota Connected - Associate Software Engineer</h3>
    <h4>2017 - Present</h4>
    <p>Toyota Connected was created as a subsidiary to Toyota so that it can deliver solutions in an agile way. One of my favorite things about working at Toyota Connected is that I've participated in some key architectural discussions; they've given me a deeper understanding of how to make microservices work best and how to design a system as a whole. I'm also getting to solidify my experience with Java, RESTful APIs, Docker, CI/CD, and Scrum practices every day.</p>
    <p>I've always enjoyed passing on what I've learned to others, so it was awesome to have the opportunity to mentor some of our Summer 2017 interns! It was rewarding to be a part of their experience and watching them grow as engineers.</p>

    <h3>Vinli - Software Engineer</h3>
    <h4>2016 - 2017</h4>
    <p>Vinli is a Dallas based startup that has created the first truly open platform for the connected car. I was a part of the 4-member Platform Team that built and maintained the 60+ microservices that made up the Vinli Platform. My main responsibilities were exposing and manipulating vehicle data through our microservices' RESTful APIs. It was empowering to be responsible for my code from start to finish, we were able to push our new features and changes at a moment's notice with little to no downtime! To ensure I was writing high quality code, I also wrote useful unit/integration tests and tested my changes in our production-like development stack. I had a blast working with one of the most talented teams in the world, and gained invaluable experience at Vinli!</p>

    <h3>Nectar Online Media - Software Developer Intern</h3>
    <h4>Jan - Aug of 2015</h4>
    <p>NectarOM offers a suite of tools to help clients with marketing personalization. As an intern, I interacted directly with some of our clients and built on top of our web application tools. Some of my tasks were writing marketing emails in HTML and writing MongoDB query scripts with Node.js to generate customer reports for our clients. My favorite part of working at NectarOM was helping rebuild our architecture by moving our services to RESTful APIs using hapi.js and refactoring our PHP web apps to Ember CLI. I love how APIs allow you to decouple your server technologies from client side applications.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tools - Git, Docker, Ansible</li>
      <li>Programming Languages - JavaScript, Python</li>
      <li>Web Technologies - Node.js, Ember.js, Hapi.js, MongoDB</li>

    <h3>University of Texas at Dallas</h3>
    <h4>2011 - 2014</h4>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas in the Fall of 2014 with a B.S in Computer Science. During my time as a student at UTD I was an AES recipient and was heavily involved in the Omega Delta Phi Fraternity. I was also a member of CSG, a group where we learned about computer security concepts. I'm no expert at computer security, but it was fun learning and doing small exercises like script injection.</p>

    <h3>Google Computer Science Summer Institute</h3>
    <h4>Summer 2011</h4>
    <p>Google CSSI is a program hosted at Google's Mountain View campus for graduating high school seniors. The purpose of the program is to get students more interested in computer science and help those students develop technical skills. This was the first time I was exposed to programming and also when I decided computer science was the career for me. My CSSI class was taught programming fundamentals by using Google's App Inventor to build simple Android applications. We then graduated to learning to write in Python so we could build web applications using Google's App Engine service. I learned how powerful programming and web applications could be.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tools - Google App Inventor, Google App Engine</li>
      <li>Programming Languages - Python, JavaScript</li>
      <li>Web Technologies - HTML5, CSS3</li>

<span>Hacking</span>
<p>By "hacking" I mean building or tinkering with things related to tech, not in the "computer hacker" kind of way. My favorite places to hack at are "hackathons." Hackathons are events where a bunch of people build things together as fast as they can, usually in a time window of 24 hours. Hackathons are hard but it's also fun to build and break things!</p>

<span>Omega Delta Phi</span>
<p>Omega Delta Phi is a multicultural service/social fraternity that I became a part of in the Spring of 2012. Our goals are to help graduate our members and give back to our communities. Thanks to my Fraternity, I've learned how to work in a team of diverse people. My chapter is recognized for our community service and also for being one of top performing ODPhi chapters. One of the best experiences in my life has been serving as our chapter president at UT Dallas. I'm currently getting involved as an alumni by helping in our national technology cabinet. </p>
