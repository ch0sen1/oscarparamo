{{#paper-card title='Home' class='home'}}
<p>Welcome to my personal website and development playground! I built this website so I could have a place to share
  information about myself and anything I've worked on. I plan to link or host any future projects here, so check in
  whenever you'd like.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun building this website and learned a lot in the process, so the first thing I'll be sharing here is
  my website's source code! If you're interested, there's a link at the bottom that'll take you to my GitHub page.</p>
